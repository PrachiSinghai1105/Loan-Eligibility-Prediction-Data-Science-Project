Summary:

Loan-Eligibility-Prediction-Data-Science-Project involves creating a loan approval prediction system in Python, featuring a graphical user interface (GUI).
The project utilizes various libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit, Seaborn, Tkinter, and Joblib, along with encoding techniques like Label Encoder.
Steps include data collection, preparation, understanding and implementation of algorithms like Decision Tree, Naive Bayes, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and others, followed by hyperparameter tuning and model evaluation, culminating in a final presentation and system demonstration.
